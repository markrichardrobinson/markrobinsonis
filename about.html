          I serve as a minister, writer, and artist, working with congregations and communities
          who live close to the edge — close to illness, uncertainty, injustice, and grace.

            <h2>Ministry and work</h2>
            <p>
              My days move between church halls, hospital corridors, and station platforms.
              I preach, listen, sit in meetings that decide the future of buildings,
              and stand alongside people whose lives carry more weight than most policies
              ever admit.
            </p>
            <p>
              The work on this site grows out of that ministry: sermons that turn into
              chapters, prayers that return as poems, sketchbook lines that become
              prints and covers. None of it is detached from real congregations
              and real streets.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="book-detail-column">
            <h2>Writing, art, and theology</h2>
            <p>
              I write in the overlap between Black theology, liberation theology,
              womanist insights, and the everyday faith of people who keep showing up
              even when the world makes that difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
              The drawings stay simple on purpose: boats, hands, railway lines, shoes.
              Each line tries to honour those whose stories rarely make it onto gallery
              walls or front pages. I believe God is present in those stories, sharing
              breath and bearing weight with us.
            </p>

            <h2>What you’ll find here</h2>
            <p>
              You will find a novel that sits with illness and endurance, an art project
              that sits with dangerous journeys, and a journal that gathers small pieces
              of reflection, prayer, and resistance. Everything here is offered as
              conversation, not conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any of this meets you where you are, you are welcome to carry it
              into your own work, your own church, your own acts of quiet refusal and hope.
